	<h3> Who to go with</h3>
		<blockquote>  "I have found out that there is no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them."- Mark Twain" </blockquote>	
	<h4> Put a lot of thought into who you will travel with.</h4>
	<h5> You will be spending a lot of time together</h5>
	<h6> <strong>A LOT</strong> of time together... </h6>
	<aside> This is an aside. <code> With a piece of computer code in it.</code>
			<p> Traveling alone is also an option. The benefits of traveling alone are: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> You can do whatever you want.</li>
				<li> You don't have to listen to someone else's terrible music. </li>
			</ul>
